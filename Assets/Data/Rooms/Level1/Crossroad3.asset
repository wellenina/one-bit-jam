  flavorText: 'Now that your steps are clear, continue along the path before you.
    The crossroads has finally come to an end and you can leave the town and its
    people behind.


    The cobbled path plunges into dense bush. In the distance,
    the cry of an animal you don''t recognize seems to want to accompany your steps.

    In
    the shadows something seems to move. You are not alone.'
