  flavorText: 'Exploring the Forest will require luck and courage. You will be faced
    with choices, but more often than not your fate will be determined by a roll
    of the dice.


    The place where you are now, at the edge of the Forest, is
    still brighten by faint glimmers of light.

    For this reason, the dice you
    roll are WHITE. White dice have less chance of harming you, but will allow you
    to collect fewer Cinders.'
