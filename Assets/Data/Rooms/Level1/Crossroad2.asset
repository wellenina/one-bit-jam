  flavorText: 'Further into the Forest you will encounter more dangerous places,
    the places where not even a glimmer of light is left.


    In these places you
    will find and roll the BLACK dice. Black dice are more dangerous, but will allow
    you to collect more Cinders.


    If you don''t want to risk it, you can turn
    on the torch you carry with you. But it''s a precious resource that will run
    out quickly: make good use of it.


    The choice is yours.'
